# Biertijd Downloader: Reloaded
This is a recreation of one of my very first projects. It is smaller, better and faster than the original!

Features:
* Less than 50 lines of actual code, of which only 17 lines actual logic (including console output),
* Multithreaded using Parallel, so super fast,
* Fancy output, it even has a progress bar per album! :)
